# DFA-automata
Algorithm and code to generate DFA

### Issues in current softwares

DFA is first and most important activity in compiler design. It is used to describe a regular expression which helps in solving logical problems such as pattern matching, path finding and speech processing. However, novel learners andresearchersface difficulty in designing the Deterministic finite automaton (DFA) as this theoretical concept of automata theory does not have well-structuredmathematical formulas or algorithms i.e. if the input problem changes then the approach to design the corresponding DFA also changes. Hence, it is the need of the hour to come up with a well-definedalgorithm. Researchers use JFLAP tool to handle these issues in DFA designing, but it has a major limitation that designing is manual in JFLAP. It is laborious to design a DFA manually and it does not handle validation of input alphabets and strings as well. JFLAP has no feature to draw a transition table, which is helpful in better understanding for learners. The researchers use JFLAP tools for demonstration of acceptance or rejection of a particular example with few strings.

### Solution offered

The central idea is to give researchers and beginners an algorithm through which they can generate required DFAs both easily and accurately in a timely manner. The proposed algorithm will provide a transition table,transition graph,and string processing which together as a whole provides a great insight to understand and implement  computation  models  easily.The objective of this paper is to give a well-defined algorithm to designa DFA for having suffix, prefix and substring patternfor a given string
